# 19YearStockMarketGame
Illustration of historical stock prices across multiple sectors
 
This is a python script that uses matplotlib to illustrate historical stock prices of companies across multiple industry sectors. The data file (19_YEAR_CHALLENGE.csv) has snapshot data of 12 indian public companies starting from the year 2000 to year 2019. These charts were originally intended for a stock market fantasy game, but they can be repurposed for other needs as well.

To restrict the range of the chart, update the variable `chart_till` with the appropriate year.
